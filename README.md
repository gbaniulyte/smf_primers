# smf_primers
Script to design primers for a bisulfate-converted DNA template (Single Molecule Footprinting experiment)
- Used to get the best possible primer pair for a given DHS region with our favorite TF binding motif
- Indicates if "GC" present in the motif
- Takes into account 3' end GC presence
- Makes primers with "Y" to increase chances of amplifying templates with incomplete bisulfate conversion
- Tm parameters optimized for NEB Q5
